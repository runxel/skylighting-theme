# Template for Skylight

> Easy CSS styling for pandoc `code`.

This repo aims to be a template to make your own highlighting styles for the CSS output [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) is giving you.
More general they can be utilized for every code snippet that is highlighted by either [highlighting-kate](https://github.com/jgm/highlighting-kate) or [Skylighting](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting).

Some example code in [tests](/tests) is borrowed from highlighting-kate.
